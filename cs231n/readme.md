## cs231n assignments

As I didn't actually enroll the class and just followed it out of personal interest the solutions may be partial, incomplete, inefficient etc.
Mostly made for my self-studying of the topics in the course.

The notebooks assume the zip of the assignment is in the directory. They unzip the skeleton and download the stanford dataset.
To try the solutions one then have to copy the cs231n folder onto the skeleton and replace. Only then the notebook is ready for full execution (2nd run and onwards).
